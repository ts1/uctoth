# Uctoth

Othello (Reversi) game engine written in CoffeeScript 2.
Demo page is [here](https://ts1.github.io/uctoth/).

## Experimental

This code is mostly experimental, not intended for reuse.
Reusing may some work.
Read the source if you are interested.

## Features

### CoffeeScript 2

Works both on Node.js with ES6+ features and on [browsers](https://ts1.github.io/uctoth/) with help from babel and webpack.

### Self learning

Starting from random plays, strengthens itself by a loop of self playing and machine learning.
Uses no existing records of games.

Included `scores.json` file is a result of 30 iterations of 1,000 self-plays and learnings.
10 days work of a MacBook Pro.

### Search algorithm

Employs modified UTC search.
Searches 15-25 plies deep maximum on modern JavaScript engines.
Beats minimax by 70-80% win rate in my tests.

### Evaluation

Classic pattern-based evaluation method described in publications by Michael Buro, who is the god of computer othello for me.

## Usage

Most scripts needs `scores.json` file in this directory.
Copy from `ref` directory or build your own.

```
cp ref/scores.json .
```
