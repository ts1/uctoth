# Uctoth

Othello (Reversi) game engine written in CoffeeScript 2.
Demo page is [here](https://ts1.github.io/uctoth/).

## Experimental

This code is mostly experimental, not intended for reuse.
Reusing may need some work.
Read the source if you are interested.

## Features

### CoffeeScript 2

Works both on Node.js (with ES6+ features) and on [browsers](https://ts1.github.io/uctoth/) (with help from babel and webpack).

### Self learning

Starting from random plays, strengthens itself by a loop of self playing and machine learning.
Uses no existing records of games.

Included `scores.json` file is a result of 30 iterations of 1,000 self-plays and learnings.
10 days work of a MacBook Pro.

### Search algorithm

Employs modified UTC search.
Searches 15-25 plies deep maximum on modern JavaScript engines.
Beats my implementation of minimax by 70-80% winning rate.

### Evaluation

Classic pattern-based evaluation method as described in publications by Michael Buro.
He is the god of computer othello for me.

## Usage

Most scripts expects `scores.json` file existing in this directory.
Copy from `ref` directory at first (then build your own).

```
cp ref/scores.json .
```
